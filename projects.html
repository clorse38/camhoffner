            <p>One of my hobbies is repairing and restoring old or broken Gameboys.</p>
            <p>Here are some of the Gameboys I've referbished:</p>

            <h3>Original Gameboy</h3>
            <div class="gameboy-description">
              This is one of the first models of Gameboys that was released. This one that I have is from 1989. It was working when I bought it so I just cleaned the dust from it and touched it up a bit. I'm a big fan of the clear plastic because I love being able to see the electronics inside.

        <h3>Gameboy Pocket</h3>
        <div class="gameboy-description">
          The Gameboy Pocket came out in 1996. When I got it there was bad battery corrosion on the terminals so I just cleaned that out with some white vinegar. It's a lot slimmer than the original Gameboy, which feels more comfortable in my tiny hands.

        <h3>Gameboy Advance</h3>
        <div class="gameboy-description">
          The Gameboy Advance was released in 2000. This Gameboy Advance in particular was missing some buttons and the battery cover, so I ordered some replacement ones online. I really like the pink color of this one!

        <h3>Gameboy Advance SP</h3>
        <div class="gameboy-description">
          This is a Gameboy Advance SP, released in 2003. This is the Gameboy I had as a child, and it was black originally, but I recently switched it into a clear plastic case because I just think it looks cooler. This also the one I play the most often because of its backlit screen.
